% For centuries people have noted that the face of the sun is not
% constant or uniform in appearance, but that darker regions appear
% at random locations on a cyclical basis.  This activity is correlated
% with weather and other economically significant terrestrial phenomena.
% In 1848, Rudolf Wolfer proposed a rule that combined the number and
% size of these sunspots into a single index.  Using archival records,
% astronomers have applied Wolfer's rule to determine sunspot activity
% back to the year 1700.  Today the sunspot index is measured by many
% astronomers and the worldwide distribution of the data is coordinated
% by the Solar Influences Data Center at the Royal Observatory of Belgium.
% 
% The text file sunspot.dat in the matlab/demos directory has two columns
% of numbers.  The first column is the years from 1700 to 1987 and the
% second column is the average Wolfer sunspot number for each year.

    n = length(wolfer);

% There is a slight upward trend to the data.  A least squares fit
% gives the trend line.

% You can definitely see the cyclic nature of the phenomenon.
% The peaks and valleys are a little more than 10 years apart.
% Now, subtract off the linear trend and take the finite Fourier transform.

    y = wolfer - trend;
    Y = fft(y);

% The vector |Y|.^2^2 is the power in the signal.
% A plot of power versus frequency is a periodogram.
% We prefer to plot |Y|, rather than |Y|.^2, because the
% scaling is not so exaggerated.
% The sample rate for this data is one observation per year,
% so the frequency #f# has units of cycles per year.

% As expected, there is a very prominent cycle with a length of
% about 11.1 years.  This shows that over the last 300 years,
% the period of the sunspot cycle has been slightly over 11 years.
