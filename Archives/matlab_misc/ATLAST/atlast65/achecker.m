function A=achecker(n)% The command A=achecker(n) generates an nxn matrix A% whose entries alternate between 1 and 0. Specifically% C(i,j)=1 if i+j is odd, otherwise C(i,j)=0. This matrix% is similar to the checker matrix except the matrix begins% with a 0 as its (1,1) entry while the checker matrix % starts with a one. For example the command achecker(4) % will generate  the matrix%%                  0  1  0  1%                  1  0  1  0  %                  0  1  0  1%                  1  0  1  0C=ones(n,1)*[1:n];A=rem(C+C',2);
