% The nullspace matrix N contains the "special solutions" to Ax=0. 
% They are a basis for the nullspace. Each special solution has one free 
% variable set to 1, the other free variables set to zero.

% The 3 by 1 matrix C = B' has only x = 0 in its nullspace. The nullspace is Z!
% The dimension is zero. The matrix N is empty. The columns are independent

% FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM:  The columns of N are orthogonal to the rows of A. 
% A * N = zero matrix.  What happens if we ask for null(N')??
% Watch the rows and also watch the ROW SPACE.
