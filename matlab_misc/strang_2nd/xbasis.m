% A basis consists of independent vectors whose combinations produce the whole
% subspace. Different combinations of basis vectors  produce different vectors!
% basis.m  knocks out dependent columns to leave a basis for the column space.

% Question 1: Given n  vectors, how would you decide if they are independent?
%  
% Question 2: How can you tell if a vector b is a combination of those vectors?
%  
% Question 3: Given TWO sets of vectors, how can you tell if they span the same
% subspace? Each vector must be a combination of the vectors in the OTHER SET.
%   
% Idea: Put the first vectors in the columns of A and put both sets in the
% columns of C. Look at basis(A) and basis(C). Does this give a complete answer?
%   
% Question 4: For a 3 by 4 matrix A what is the important fact about basis(A)
%   and basis(A')?
